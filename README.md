This design was heavily influnced by https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6850215.  I modified it to suit my specific needs, and to address some shortcomings in the design:

1. Added a robust BL Touch mount as the top of my BL Touch is falling apart.
2. Adjusted the belt path height for my MGN-12 top mounted rails AND to avoid the issue where the original desing needed spacers on the orint bed to raise it.
3. Adpated the design to accomodate my two different hot end--The Creality Spider Pro and a TZ-V6.
